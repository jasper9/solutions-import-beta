Active Directory (AD) is a directory service created by Microsoft for Windows domain networks. It is included in most of the Windows Server operating systems. Active Directory provides a central location for network administration and security.

Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS for short) is a software component developed by Microsoft that can be installed on Windows Server operating systems to provide users with Single Sign-On access to systems and applications located across organizational boundaries. It uses a claims-based access control authorization model to maintain application security and implement federated identity. Claims based authentication is the process of authenticating a user based on a set of claims about its identity contained in a trusted token.
