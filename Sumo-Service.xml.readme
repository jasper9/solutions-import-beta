Sumo Logic provides a cloud-based log management and analytics service that helps customers collect, manage, and extract insights from their log and machine data.
Through deploying Sumo Logic Collectors (a small software agent that runs on your server or log collection device) customers can collect, compress, and securely transfer log and machine data from one or more systems to the Sumo Logic service in real-time. 
Then, using the Sumo Logic browser-based application, customers can then analyze, report, and alert on their log and machine data.  

As part of the VMware application marketplace, customers can easily download a Sumo Logic collector as part of any application they create with VMware vFabric Application Director.  
This offers VMware customers an easy way to collect and analyze log and machine data generated by that application as well other applications, operating systems, networks, and infrastructure.
As a result customers can improve their application uptime and operational posture.
