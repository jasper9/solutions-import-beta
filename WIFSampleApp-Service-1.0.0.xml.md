## Success
Your service has been successfully imported and ready to go but first there are a few final steps you need to follow before you can perform a deployment.

### Next Steps
1. In the WIFSampleApp Service, you need to ensure that you have configured the **wifinstaller** content property to point to the location of your WIF SDK installer.This can be obtained as a Microsoft download WindowsIdentityFoundation-SDK-3.5.msi from their site http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=4451
