Drupal is a content management platform that allows an individual or community of users to easily publish, manage, and organize a wide variety of content on a website. In general, Drupal is used for community web portals, discussion sites, corporate web sites, intranet applications, personal web sites or blogs, aficionado sites, e-commerce applications, resource directories, and social networking sites. Drupal is easy to extend by plugging in one or more of the dozens of freely available modules.
