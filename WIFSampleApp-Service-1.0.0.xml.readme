Windows Identity Foundation (WIF) is a rich identity model framework designed for building claims-based applications and services and for supporting  active and passive federated security scenarios. With WIF, you can enable passive federation for any ASP.NET application, and integrate a claims-based authorization model into your ASP.NET applications and WCF services without breaking a sweat. Furthermore, WIF provides the plumbing to build customs implementations, and includes features and controls to support authentication scenarios that involve managed information cards and identity selectors such as Windows CardSpace.

*When dealing with setting up properties in this demo take care about the property type. If you are downloading any file this must be of type content. If you use another type there is a good chance your deployment will fail.
