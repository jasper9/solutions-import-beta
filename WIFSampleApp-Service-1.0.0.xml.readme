Windows Identity Foundation (WIF) is a rich identity model framework designed for building claims-based applications and services and for supporting active and passive federated security scenarios. With WIF, you can enable passive federation for any ASP.NET application, and integrate a claims-based authorization model into your ASP.NET applications and WCF services without breaking a sweat.
