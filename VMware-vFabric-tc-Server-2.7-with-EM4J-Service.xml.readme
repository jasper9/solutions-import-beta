vFabric tc Server, the best place to build and run Java Spring applications, provides enterprise users with the lightweight server they want paired with the operational management, advanced diagnostics, and mission-critical support capabilities businesses need. Designed to be a drop-in replacement for Apache Tomcat, vFabric tc Server ensures a seamless migration path for existing custom-built and commercial software applications already certified for Tomcat.
vFabric Elastic Memory for Java (EM4J) enables memory to be shared dynamically among tc Server instances without sacrificing performance.  Working in concert with VMware vSphere, EM4Jâ€™s memory balloon functionality lets you create smaller virtual machines for running tc Server, and deploy more of these VMs on each vSphere host,
Thus squeezing maximum value from existing core hardware infrastructure.
